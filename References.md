## Symbol Reference

The following symbol is used in this documentation. We use P90/P50/P10 as a generic symbol instead of using specific symbols such as R (GRR), C (Contingent), U (Prospective) for generic rules that apply equally to GRR, Contingent Resources, and Prospective Resources. In case of reserves, 1P/2P/3P is used.
